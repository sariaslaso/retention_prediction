    "Both `train.csv` and `test.csv` contain one row for each unique specialization subscription. For each subscription, a single observation (`subscription_id`) is included as of a particular date (`observation_dt`) during which the subscription was active. This date was chosen at random from all the dates during which the subscription was active. In some instances it is soon after the subscription was initiated; in other instances, it is several months after the subscription was initiated and after several previous payments were made. Therefore, your model will have to be able to adapt to different stages of the subscription.\n",
